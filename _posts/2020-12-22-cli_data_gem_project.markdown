My approach to this project is probably unlike most people's. Most people will go in the order of the general syllabus that's provided here at Flatiron Coding school. Me however... well. Here's my story.

*My "Story"*
After several hard months of coding and late nights, I finally reached the CLI Data Gem project. My adventure up to this point had not been the easiest, because I certainly wasn't as consistent as I should have been when it came to finishing these modules. Specifically, I would work hard for maybe a week or two, and then take a month hiatus before jumping back into the curriculum. The major impact this hiatus had was the necessity to re-learn/remember everything. Imagine learning a new language, such as Japanese, for a month or two, but very intermittently... yes you thought right -- it'd be very difficult and just wildly inefficient way to go about it.

It must have been about mid July 2020, several months after all the covid lockdown and panic, when I took my longest hiatus from coding -- about a month and a half. By the time I came back to the curriculum, I honestly couldn't remember much. I tried tackling the CLI Data Gem project and would end up spending hours with almost negligible progress. After about a week of this, I felt hopeless and felt the most de-motivated from finishing this curriculum. Instead of quitting altogether though, I decided to just keep moving on with the curriculum. I told myself that once I felt comfortable again, and had a better understanding of scraping data, html, css, and ruby in general, I would revisit the project.

Come December 2020, I had finally made my way through Module 11: CSS. I honestly couldn't have felt more comfortable about HTML and CSS until I went through Modules 10 and 11. I figured that this would be the best time for me to revisit the project with my knowledge in HTML and CSS being so fresh. My gut instinct was entirely correct. After working for about 8 hours a day from Friday through Sunday, I managed to get through writing the entire app. Honestly couldn't have done it without my girlfriend studying for her graduate school final exams next to me though. Seeing her work hard allowed me to stay motivated and truck through this project.

*What my project was about*
I wanted to make an app that allowed the user to see various metrics of a list of charity organizations. Sometimes, it's a pain in the butt to click forward and back through websites to look at how awesome or horrible a charity organization is. I designed my app to make the user experience more friendly, so their "giving" and "charity" mindset don't disappear, because they get tired of researching for charity organizations. Maybe that doesn't happen to others, but it can happen to me when I'm researching for food. If your restaurant website is too complex and not user friendly, I probably wouldn't order from you!

*What did I learn?*
Going through this project has honestly given me a much better understanding of object-oriented programming. The way objects interact with each other and how they learn to know each other's existence is conceptually something I found difficult to begin with... which I would argue is the main component of OO programming... hence the name OO -- "object oriented".

*What Helped Me?*
I think what helped me the most in finishing this project was the Eden project videos. The Eden project videos explained the "why" and "what", which is something I didn't really get since I'm a self-paced student.  It's amazing how much of a difference it makes when you hear someone dumb things down for you, explain concepts step by step, and provide live examples.

*My advice to self-paced students*
If I had to give any of you advice (for self-paced students), don't be like me and just keep chugging along at a consistent pace. It's nice to get 1 month of work done in 2 weeks, but you will burn out.
